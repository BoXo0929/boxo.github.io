            is my capstone project, an art gallery located in Ottawa that
            specializes in the professional presentation and promotion of visual
            and media arts. Each year, G101 hosts an exciting series of solo and
            group exhibitions, featuring works by contemporary Canadian and
            international artists across various mediums. The gallery also
            provides services and professional development opportunities for
            artists, curators, writers, and critics.
          </p>
          <p>
            As one of the UI/UX designers on the project, my role involved
            conducting user research, creating wireframes, designing the UI,
            developing prototypes, and working on high-fidelity designs. I was
            also responsible for implementation, content management, and
            creating 3D floor plans for the gallery.

        <h3>challenge</h3>
        <p>
          The website's design might feel outdated or lack a modern, visually
          appealing aesthetic. Contemporary websites in the arts sector often
          use clean layouts, strong typography, and high-quality images.
          Updating the design without losing the gallery’s identity or
          overwhelming visitors with too much visual information could be
          challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
          The navigation may not be intuitive, and users might struggle to find
          the information they're looking for (e.g., upcoming exhibitions,
          artist profiles). Improving the UX without making the site feel
          cluttered is key.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lack of visually rich, immersive displays of the actual exhibition
          spaces. Visitors often want to get a sense of what the gallery looks
          like and how artworks are presented within it. Without these visual
          cues, it becomes harder for online users to connect with the physical
          space or feel motivated to visit in person. This lack of visual
          representation might make the website feel disconnected from the
          gallery’s core mission of showcasing visual art.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container3">
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          Introduce a modern, minimalist design that uses whitespace effectively
          and highlights artwork. Consider refreshing the colour palette, fonts,
          and layout to provide a more immersive, modern experience while
          staying true to the gallery's artistic identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conduct usability testing to understand where users face difficulties,
          and redesign the information architecture to streamline navigation.
          Enhancing the menu structure, adding clear calls to action, and
          improving content discoverability can enhance the experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add a 3D virtual tour of the gallery, where users can explore the
          exhibition spaces as if they were physically present. This could be
          achieved through 360-degree photography or virtual rendering software
          like Matterport. Users can navigate the gallery at their own pace,
          viewing each artwork in its actual setting, creating a more engaging
          and immersive experience.

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
          Conducting thorough research is essential when redeveloping a website
          to ensure functionality and engaging storytelling. As we began the
          process of redeveloping Gallery 101’s website, our first step was to
          audit the existing site to determine which elements to retain, remove,
          or modify. The current website was well-designed, so we found several
          features worth keeping. Specifically, we decided to retain the logo
          (with a modification in the header menu), the white background, and
          many of the existing pages, though some would be renamed.
          Additionally, we planned to introduce a new "Resources" menu that
          consolidates the resources and artist-run sections currently under
          "Get Involved."
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we explored other art gallery websites to identify consistent
          design trends. A common theme we noticed was the use of full-screen
          images as backgrounds, with each design element highlighted by unique
          colours. Based on this insight, we opted to incorporate a full-screen
          image showcasing the G101 building and integrate the gallery’s
          signature orange into the top navigation menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we reconsidered our initial idea to rebrand the website's
          colours, logo, and background. After further discussion, we chose to
          retain the original logo but create a new design for the header
          banner. We also restructured the navigation system to improve the
          overall user flow, ensuring a more intuitive experience for visitors.
